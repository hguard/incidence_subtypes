**Abstract**


Prostate cancer is molecularly heterogeneous. Common molecular subtypes of primary prostate cancer have striking differences in prevalence by race. However, prevalence is estimated among patients with cancer diagnoses and does not capture racial disparities in incidence. We estimated prostate cancer incidence rates for molecular subtypes, which reflect the absolute burden of new diagnoses among all men annually, based on subtype prevalence and overall prostate cancer incidence from SEER (2017-2021). Subtypes studied included prostate cancer with (1) TMPRSS2:ERG fusions, (2) non-ERG ETS fusions, (3) SPOP mutations, and (4) PTEN loss. While prevalence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions was twice as high in White than Black men, incidence was similar. Prevalence of non-ERG ETS fusions was highest among White men, but incidence was highest among Black men. Prevalence of SPOP mutations was similar between White and Black men, but incidence was highest among Black men. While PTEN loss prevalence was lower in Black men, incidence was similar, driven by loss in tumors without TMPRSS2:ERG. Data for Asian men were limited across subtypes. Collectively, patterns of subtype incidence differed from prevalence. We posit that subtype incidence rates are more informative than prevalence for insights into etiology, prevention, and racial disparities in prostate cancer and other cancer types.
