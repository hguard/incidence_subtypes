# Data 
This folder contains data included in, "Population-based incidence rates of prostate cancer molecular subtypes by race." 

**`ERG_PTEN_Hopkins_processed.csv`**: Processed data on the Hopkins cohorts for ERG and PTEN status 
- `source`: data source; Hopkins, 2024
- `race`: race 
- `subtype`: subtype of interest (ERG negative/PTEN intact, ERG negative/any PTEN loss, ERG positive/PTEN intact, ERG positive/any PTEN loss)
- `cases`: cases with a given subtype and race 
- `total`: total number of cases in each racial group 
- `prevalence`: race-specific prevalence of the subtype 

**`SEER_Incidence.csv`**: Dataset generated by Claire Kim. 5-year age adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates 2017-2021 for White (includes Hispanic), Black (includes Hispanic), and Asian men from the SEER-Explorer Application
- `source`: data source 	
- `race`: Asian, Black (including Hispanic), White (including Hispanic)	
- `incidence`: 5-year age adjusted incidence rates 2017-2021 (in cases per 100,000 men per year) 
- `found`: description of how the incidence rates were pulled

**`SPOP_counts.csv`**: Dataset generated by Hannah Guard. SPOP positive tumor counts and total participants were pulled from TCGA 2015, Yuan 2020, Blattner 2014, Khani 2014, and Stopsack 2021. We specifically included counts from patients with localized disease and primary prostate samples due to the association between SPOP and prognosis/metastases. 
- `source`: data source 	
- `race`: Asian, Black, White (with varying definitions from source studies in terms of ancestry etc) 
- `subtype`: SPOP for all
- `cases`: number of cases with the SPOP subtype
- `total`: total number of cases included in study (with SPOP data)
- `found`: description of how the data were pulled

**`Subtype_prevalence.csv`**: Dataset generated by Claire Kim, pulling prevalence estimates from two studies: Zhou 2017 and Tomlins 2015. 
- `source`: data source 	
- `race`: Asian, Black, White (with varying definitions from source studies in terms of ancestry etc) 
- `subtype`: molecular subtype (ERG, non-ERG ETS)
- `prevalence`: prevalence of the subtype
- `total`: total number of cases included in study (with subtype data)
- `zhou_lower`: 95% lower confidence limit pulled directly from Zhou meta-analysis  	
- `zhou_upper`: 95% upper confidence limit pulled directly from Zhou meta-analysis  	
- `location`: description of how the data were pulled


**`prad_tcga_pub_clinical_data_07122024.tsv`**: The TCGA subtype prevalence data was downloaded from the following link: https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=prad_tcga_pub on 07/12/2024 by selecting "download clinical data for the selected cases: (no filtering was done prior to downloading the dataset). In our analysis, we used the `Race Category` and `Subtype` variables to determine the counts of cases by race with each subtype and from there the prevalence of each molecular subtype by race in TCGA 2015. The counts we computed match the subtype counts listed on the cBioPortal webpage by race.
